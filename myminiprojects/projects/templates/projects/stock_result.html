  This stock( <a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/">{{stock_name}}</a> ) is currently showing 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_trend"><b>{{trend}}</b></a> tred. Which is calculated by 
  taking average growth of 20 days' as <b>faster-moving average</b> and 50 days' average as moving average
  as <b>slower-moving average</b>. <br>
  Thus if 20-days' moving average goes up and crosses 50-days' moving average, it will show a
  bullish market since it indicates an upward trend in the past 20-daysâ€™ stocks. Whereas, 
  if the 20-days' moving average goes below the 50-days' moving average, it will be bearish 
  since it means that the stocks fell in the past 20-days
